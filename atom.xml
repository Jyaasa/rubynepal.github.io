    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After months of hurdles and fuel crisis, weâ€™re finally continuing our monthly Ruby Meetup. Around 30 ruby enthusiasts showed up for the december meetup held on 20th December 2015. I was very glad and a little nervous to host the event for the very first time. I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/zoraslapen">Saroj</a> dai for providing me the opportunity to host the event.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/7/600_445174967.jpeg"></p>

<p>First speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/nivdul">Ludwine Probst</a>, data engineer from France. Despite having Mathematics as her academic background, she talked about how she is enjoying her career as a software developer. She also shared her experience as a developer in France. She explained her journey from France to Asian countries to know more about the woman involvement on IT world. Rather than a talk, it was an interactive session with the meetup participants.</p>

<p>Second speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/gkunwar1">Ganesh Kunwar</a>, Sr. Ruby Developer from Jyaasa on the topic &ldquo;Test Driven Development(TDD Basics)&rdquo;. He briefly explained on how TDD can be practiced easily with gems like RSpec, Test/Unit, Capybara with some code samples. He shared his experience on TDD workflow on codebase. He shed some light on TDD (Test Driven Development) and DDT (Development Driven Test) approach which not only clarified the value of TDD in QC (Quality Control) but also significantly improving the overall architecture of the system design itself. You can download the  slides <a href="http://files.meetup.com/18762323/Test%20Driven%20Development%20%28TDD%29%20-%20Ruby%20Nepal%20Meetup%20-%20Dec%2020%2C2015.pdf">here</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The monthly Ruby Meetup was held on the 2nd Sunday of September last week. Local ruby enthusiasts came together to quench and moreover arouse appetite for learning.</p>

<p>Two presentations were given during the meetup. First was a follow-up of our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/events/224417878/">last meetup</a> on front-end development; <strong>Asset Management in Rails</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/josisusan"><em>Susan Joshi</em></a>. Things got serious when <a href="https://twitter.com/prasvinp"><em>Prasvin Pandey</em></a> steered ahead to dive into <strong>MetaProgramming in Ruby</strong>. Gladly no-one dozed off as things got pretty cozy.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can download the slides and example codes from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nepal-Ruby-Users-Group/files/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) <a href="http://leapfrog.academy/courses_ror.php">Leapfrog.Academy</a> who are currently teaching a course on <em>Web Development with Ruby on Rails</em>.</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://codysseynepal.com/">Codyssey Web Nepal</a>, a RoR dev shop.</p>

<p>In a true developer fashion, going forward we&rsquo;ll be using github to manage meetup presentations. You can go ahead and open issues in <a href="https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues">https://github.com/RubyNepal/rorh/issues</a> for:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The tech scene in Kathmandu is ever growing but it is rather lacking a sense of community. Dev Meetup aims to fill this void with a regular meetup for developers where like minded individuals can gather, get to know each other and share their ideas/views.</p>

<p>The first successful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/768447783198796/">Dev Meetup</a> was held on July 26, 2014 at CloudFactory, the next Dev Meetup is scheduled for August 30th, 2014 at the same venue.</p>

    <link href="http://RubyNepal.github.io/blog/2013/06/06/how-we-build-rubynepal-using-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-06T19:18:00+05:45</updated>
    <id>http://RubyNepal.github.io/blog/2013/06/06/how-we-build-rubynepal-using-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is not another getting started with octopress guide, this is sharing of our experience and couple of hacks we did while developing rubynepal, that may be helpful to others.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June 2013, We came up with this idea of building a community website for ruby developers of nepal.
We didn&rsquo;t need to have a full content management features but we needed features like blog support, pages support, ease for deployments and easy contributing mechanism. Finally, we decided to build rubynepal.org with <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> and github pages. With this we could to tap out Markdown without needing a web-based WYSIWYG editor and type a command to send everything up to the free Github Pages service and our whole website would be a github repo, perfect for collaboration.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">docs</a> has pretty neat documentation for installing octopress, configuring setting up github pages. Within few minutes basic website was up at github pages.</p>

<p>Next, themes, we forked this beautiful and responsive theme <a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade">greyshade</a> and customized it. Upto here we had a basic rubynepal.org up and running.</p>

<p>Now, octopress has its root path that displays the posts ie. essentially blog index, but we needed to have a page instead of blog index.
For this, first we moved <em>source/index.html</em> to <em>source/blog/index.html</em>. Then, created a markdown where we wrote what is to be there in homepage.
We put all such kinds of markdown inside <em>_partial</em> folder.
Then, in <em>source/index.html</em> we got rid of all exsiting code with</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>  ---
</span><span class='line'>  layout: default
</span><span class='line'>  ---
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;page_about&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    {% render_partial _partial/about.markdown %}
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This way about.markdown will be rendered in root page while blog index will be available at <em>/blog</em>.</p>

<p>Now we had to put a list of developers and advisors info in members page. One way was to dump those info to a yml file and access data from there. Matt Swanson has excellent write on how to do that in his <a href="http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/06/03/jekyll-201.html">blog</a>. With this, we could dump the data from yml file to jekyll <em>site</em> variable.</p>

<p>Finally, we built a small heroku app that powers the join page forms and we have rubynepal.org as how it is now.</p>
