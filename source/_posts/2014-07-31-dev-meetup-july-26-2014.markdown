The tech scene in Kathmandu is ever growing but it is rather lacking a sense of community. Dev Meetup aims to fill this void with a regular meetup for developers where like minded individuals can gather, get to know each other and share their ideas/views.

The meetup will be carried out monthly (last Saturday of the month) to cover web development topics like 'ruby', 'rails', 'javascript', 'devops', 'databases', etc.

After conducting the first successful [Dev Meetup on July 26, 2014](https://www.facebook.com/events/768447783198796/), next Dev Meetup will take place on Saturday, Aug 30th 2014. Go ahead and sign up if you haven't yet: [2nd Dev Meetup](https://plus.google.com/events/cr78vpsi1466vv0ldj990fdgdr8). Kudos to [CloudFactory](http://www.cloudfactory.com) for sponsoring both the events.
