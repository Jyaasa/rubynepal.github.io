This is not another getting started with octopress guide, this is sharing of our experience and couple of hacks we did while developing rubynepal, that may be helpful to others.

In the beginning of June 2013, We came up with this idea of building a community website for ruby developers of nepal.
We needed to have a content management like features and a blog support and and easy contributing mechanism. Finally, we decided to build rubynepal.org with [octopress](http://octopress.org) and github pages. With this we could to tap out Markdown without needing a web-based WYSIWYG editor and type a command to send everything up to the free Github Pages service and our whole website would be a github repo, perfect for community collaboration.

The [docs](http://octopress.org/docs/) has pretty neat documentation for installing octopress, configuring setting up github pages. Within few minutes basic website was up at github pages.
